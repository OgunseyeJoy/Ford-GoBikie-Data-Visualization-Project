# Ford-GoBikie-Data-Visualization-Project
Dataset

> The data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.

## Summary of Findings

> 1. The peak hours of the ride sharing service are around 17:00 hours and 8:00 hours of the day which are 5pm and 8am respectively. These coincide with the resumption and closing hours for most jobs which could indicate why there are increased bookings during those periods.
> 2. The average duration of rides is between 8 - 10 minutes
> 3. Thursdays appear to have the highest frequency of rides taken. This also appears explain why there were more unique bikes used between Thursdays to Fridays.
However, in terms of segmented assessment of gender against the duration of ride taken, it appears to be longest on Mondays which could be because it's the beginning of the work week.
> 4. Almost 75% of those taking rides are Males, perhaps because Males find it more convenient to take bikes compared to females.
> 5. Most of the people who take the rides are at least between the Ages 30 - 40 while a larger percentage are around ages 30 - 33 years. The duration of rides also begins to reduce with especially after 80 Years of Age.
> 6. The subscribers form about 90% of those who use the ride service and also rode rode longer in total, far more than the customers. This makes sense since it would be more economical to subscribe if the customer would require the service frequently.
> 7. The San Francisco Caltrain Station 2 and The Market Station have the highest frequencies of rides booked, this could probably be that these stations were within the central areas of residence and work.
> 8. Very few people, less than 10%, use the bike sharing service of the rides.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> The main insight for the presentation is exploring the user behaviors.
> 1. I look at the categories of people who predominantly use the ride service
> This is done by exploring the user types, and the demographics of the users
> 2. I will then assess if there are any key differences between these different user categories in terms of frequency of rides and the duration.
> This would be done by exploring the different relationships between each user category against the frequency and duration of rides.
> Finally, to further streamline the user type exploration, we would use the station with the highest frequencies, suppport our exploration to trace where most of the users work or live.
